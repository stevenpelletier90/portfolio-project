## 🏗 Project Structure

This portfolio project follows modern React development practices with a clean, modular structure:

```
portfolio-project/
├── public/            # Static assets and entry HTML
├── src/
│   ├── assets/        # Fonts and images
│   ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
│   ├── data/          # Data files (e.g. projects.js)
│   ├── layouts/       # Layout components
│   ├── pages/         # Individual page components
│   ├── styles/        # Global styles and CSS modules
│   ├── App.jsx        # Main application component
│   └── main.jsx       # Application entry point
├── .eslintrc.js       # ESLint configuration
├── vite.config.js     # Vite build configuration
└── package.json       # Project dependencies and scripts
```

Key features:

- Organized component structure for maintainability
- Separation of concerns with dedicated directories for components, pages, and styles
- Use of CSS modules for scoped styling
- Data management through a centralized data file
- Modern build setup with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

This structure demonstrates a solid understanding of React application architecture and best practices in front-end development.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
